        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Dexter Morgan, when he was only three years old, watched his mother, Laura Moser, die a gruesome death via a 
            chainsaw wielded by Santos Jimenez, under the orders of Hector Estrada. She, along with several others, were
             killed inside a shipping container, where Dexter and his brother, Brian Moser, sat abandoned for two days in 
             a pool of their blood. Officer Harry Morgan discovered the boys but he only carried Dexter out after seeing 
             in Brian's eyes that he had been permanently damaged by the experience. The other officers went in to rescue 
             Dexter's brother. At the time, Harry was unaware that Dexter would also have lasting effects from the incident
             and he decided to adopt the boy, hoping that he'd raise a normal child.</p>

        <p>The Code of Harry is a set of moral guidelines introduced in the TV series Dexter. It was created by Harry Morgan, 
            Dexter Morgan's adoptive father, to help Dexter channel his violent urges in a way that minimizes harm to innocent 
            people. The code is designed to give Dexter a sense of purpose and control over his compulsions. Here are the key
             principles of the code:Never get caught: Above all, Dexter must avoid detection to protect himself and those around him.
             Only kill those who deserve it: Dexter is instructed to target individuals who are proven murderers or who have committed 
             heinous crimes, ensuring that his actions serve a form of vigilante justice.Ensure absolute proof: Before acting, Dexter must 
             gather undeniable evidence of the target's guilt to avoid harming innocent people. </p>
