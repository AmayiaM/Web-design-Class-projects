<p>Dexter is an American crime drama television series that initially aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013.

    analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting 
    down murderers inadequately punished by the justice system due to corruption or legal technicalities. The show's first season 
    was derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for
